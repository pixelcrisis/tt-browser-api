# tt-browser-api
Interfacing with turntable.fm in the browser. Handles the heavy lifting for integrating with turntable events and functions, as well as manipulating the site itself. In the future, it will be powerful enough to use the browser to run a bot on turntable.fm. 

## [ using the api ]
Not particularly recommended - for now, it was built primarily as an API to support turnStyles (linked below). As such, some features are missing or incomplete. If this project interests you, shoot me a message and I can get this production ready!

## [ projects using TBA ]
