# tt-browser-api
Interfacing with turntable.fm in the browser. Handles the heavy lifting for integrating with turntable events and functions, as well as manipulating the site itself. In the future, it will be powerful enough to use the browser to run a bot on turntable.fm. 

## [ using the api ]
```js
let TBA = require("tt-browser-api")
let App = new TBA()

// add your functions / events 

App.Attach() // attach to turntable
````
