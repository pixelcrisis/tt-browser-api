# TBA Docs

## [ events ]
TBA renames all the native turntable events and does some minor formatting on the data. As such, it is an *opinionated* API. The events preserve the native turntable data in the `raw` subproperty. In addition to the native turntable events, TBA also includes a host of custom events.  
  
For a breakdown, check out the [events](events.md) doc

## [ functions ]
TBA includes a few quick access functions to turntable, the DOM, and to internal functions. A full breakdown is in the [functions](functions.md) doc.

## [ properties ]
For now, this is mainly quick access to `window.turntable` subproperties. A full list can be found in the [properties](properties.md) doc.
